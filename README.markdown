## Sequencer.js

Sequencer.js is an audio sampler/sequencer built in Javascript using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and the [Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html). It isn't meant to be studio-quality, but instead is meant to showcase Javascript's potential for in-browser audio production.

Version 0.1a (master branch) is live [here](http://web-audio-workbench.herokuapp.com/). This is very experimental code. If you find any bugs, feel free to take a look at the code or let me know.
